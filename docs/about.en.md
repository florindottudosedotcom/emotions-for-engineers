# About This Project

This website serves as a demonstration platform for courses automatically generated through a specialized workflow. The core of this project is the **Universal Course Creator**, a tool that leverages AI to generate comprehensive course content, including titles, descriptions, and chapter materials, and then translates them into multiple languages.

## Our Technology

-   **Content Generation:** We use AI models via Ollama to create educational content from simple prompts.
-   **Website Framework:** The site is built with [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/), a fast and simple static site generator.
-   **Theme:** We use the beautiful and highly customizable [Material for MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) theme to provide a modern, responsive user experience.
-   **Multilingual Support:** The [mkdocs-static-i18n](https://github.com/ultrabug/mkdocs-static-i18n) plugin allows us to serve the same content in multiple languages seamlessly.

The goal is to showcase a streamlined process for creating and deploying educational content at scale, with a professional and user-friendly interface.
