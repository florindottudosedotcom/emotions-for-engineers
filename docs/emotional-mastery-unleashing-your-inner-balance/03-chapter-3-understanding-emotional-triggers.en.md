# Chapter 3: Understanding Emotional Triggers

# Uncovering Hidden Patterns

Emotions are often triggered by external stimuli, like people, situations, or events. In this chapter, we'll explore how to identify and understand these emotional triggers.

**Reflection:** Think about a time when you felt strongly emotional (e.g., happy, sad, angry). What happened right before the emotion arose? Was there someone involved?

**Exercise:** Write down 3-5 scenarios that consistently trigger strong emotions in you. Practice recognizing and preparing for these situations.
