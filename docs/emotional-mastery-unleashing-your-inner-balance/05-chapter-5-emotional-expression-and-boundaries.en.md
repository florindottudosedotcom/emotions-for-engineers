# Chapter 5: Emotional Expression and Boundaries

# Finding Healthy Ways to Express Emotions

Emotions need expression, but sometimes we suppress them. In this chapter, we'll discuss the importance of emotional expression and setting healthy boundaries.

**Reflection:** Think about a time when you held back expressing your emotions due to fear or avoidance. How did it affect your relationships?

**Exercise:** Practice assertive communication by expressing your emotions in a non-confrontational way. For example, 'I feel hurt when...' instead of 'You always do this.'
